# AutoNav-Path-Planning-and-Control-for-Autonomous-Navigation
Developing a path planning algorithm( Dynamic A*,RRT) using python to avoid obstacles and for route optimization and testing it in  ROS2 and Gazebo, developed MPC and PID control algorithms using Python, reducing control errors by 25% and improving system stability by 15% 
A* algortihm basics :

A* works on the intuiton that you IDENTIFY the nodes/states you would want to explore in well defined environment. 
/n It would then evaluate the best possible node that it can expand to/ step on to. (By comparing the f value which is simply 
/n What it needs? 
It needs discrete states/nodes defined. It would break in scenarios having continuous states as there are infinite numbers between (0-->1) which
